## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r getdata}
data_file_name <- "./activity.zip"

# Unzip data file (if necessary)
unzip(data_file_name, exdir="./", overwrite=TRUE)
data <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r meansteps}
# Load in dependencies
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Group up number of steps by day and calculate total number of steps per day
data_totals <-
  data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_steps=sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

# Calculate mean and median of total steps per day
mean_steps <- mean(data_totals$total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median_steps <- median(data_totals$total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)

# Make histogram of step totals and plot vertical lines at mean and median
with(data_totals, 
     hist(data_totals$total_steps),
     labels(xlab="Total steps"),
     title(main="Histogram of Total Steps Per Day")) # << Fix this
```
